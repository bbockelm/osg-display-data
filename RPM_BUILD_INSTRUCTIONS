To build:

1) Make sure the rpm development tools are installed on the machine (the binary "rpmbuild" should be in your path).
   * If you've never built RPMs on this machine, the default destination directory is in /usr/src, which you probably don't have write access to.  You can set up an RPM environment in your home directory by doing the following:

mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
echo "%_topdir /home/brian/rpmbuild" >> ~/.rpmmacros

2) Update the version number in the following three files to be consistent:
   * src/scripts/rpm_build_script
   * config/OSG_Display_Data.spec
   * setup.py
3) Run the build script, ./src/scripts/rpm_build_script.  Upon a successful build, the output RPM will be copied to the dist/ directory.
